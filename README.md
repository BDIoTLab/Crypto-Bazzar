### Initial configuration

All the MicroKube deployment files have their confguration stored in `config/app.yml`.

Feel free to fill it out with correct values:

| Parameter         | Description                                      |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `app.name`        | Global application name                          |
| `app.domain`      | Base domain name to be used                      |
| `ssl.enabled`     | Enable SSL certificate generation                |
| `ssl.email`       | Email address to use for SSL generation requests |
| `images`          | Application images tags                          |
| `vendor`          | Frontend application Git repo URL                |

Once you're done with the configuration, render the files using `rake render:config`. You can easily apply your changes at any time by running this command.

    Note: be sure to append all the subdomains based on app.domain to your
    /etc/hosts file if you're running MicroKube locally
